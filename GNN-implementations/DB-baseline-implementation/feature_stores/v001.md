# v001 Neo4jFeatureStore

2nd working implemention of FeatureStore.
It improves on the 1st implementation by having way less object conversions and instead reading from a binary array.
Expects a cora dataset db with the following assumptions:

- 1 type of node
- relations treated as bidirectional
- features are of type `byte[]` embedding property of the node type
  and is ingested by the `data/ingest.py`-script
- targets are of type String on the property `subject`
