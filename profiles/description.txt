ncalls
  Number of times the function was called.
  If shown as A/B, A = total calls, B = primitive (non-recursive) calls.

tottime
  Total time spent in the function itself.
  Does NOT include time spent in functions it calls.

percall (tottime)
  Average self time per call.
  Computed as tottime / ncalls.

cumtime
  Total time spent in the function AND all functions it calls.
  This is the most useful column for finding bottlenecks.

percall (cumtime)
  Average cumulative time per call.
  Roughly cumtime divided by number of calls.

filename:lineno(function)
  Source location of the function.
  Built-in or C/C++ functions appear in braces.
